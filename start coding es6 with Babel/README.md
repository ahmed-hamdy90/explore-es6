## Start Coding ES6 with Babel

learning more about ES6 Feature By following steps into [tutsplus course: Start Coding ES6 With Babel](http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/start-coding-es6-with-babel).

will Using [`Babel.js`](https://babeljs.io/) to Compile ES6 Code into ES5 Code compatible.

All examples under Chapter 02, Chapter 03 and More Examples folders will Use `babel-starter` project, So

 - first install project dependencies using `npm`:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

- Run `gulp` tasks to create `dist` Folder which contains `app.bundle.js` and `index.html` files:

  ```
  ./node_modules/.bin/gulp default
  ```

#### Chapter 02 [Getting Started]:

###### Example 01: Babel on the Client

Just open `index.html` file under `dist` Folder using web Browser

###### Example 02: Babel on the Server

- run the server with `node.js`

  ```
  node server.js
  ```

- Once server has been running, Open web Browser on `localhost:9000`

#### Chapter 03 [Experimenting With ES6]:
###### Example 01: Classes
###### Example 02: Generators
###### Example 03: Other Cool Stuf

- run the server with `node.js`

  ```
  node server.js
  ```

- Once server has been running, Open web Browser on `localhost:9000`

#### More Examples: applying more examples on new ES6 feature which we had discovered into Chapter 02 and Chapter 03

###### Generators/Example 01
###### Generators/Example 02
###### Generators/Example 03
###### Other Cool Stuf/Example 01: const keyword
###### Other Cool Stuf/Example 02: let keyword

 - run the server with `node.js`

   ```
